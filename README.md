# atlas-simple_shell
Simple Shell project for Atlas Jan2024 Cohort.
This project is primarily written, tested and coded by Nathan Rhys and Danny McGeough.
The aim of this project is to create a simple shell interface capable of handling certain commands issued by a user and utilize input in ways that closesly mirror other shells like bash.
We are going to handle most built in commands such as cd or ls and also handle errors in user input and have edge cases and fail states.
The technologies used will be VSCode and the Terminal. We will also utilize certain functions contained within certain libraries (see man page for explicit mention of libraries).
